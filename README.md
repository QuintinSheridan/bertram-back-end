To run the back end, install packages with "npm install" then run the application with "npm run start".  The application is hardcoded to run on port 3000.  A simple sqlite db was created for this applications, which can cause some issues with concurrent DB requests.  Passwords are not hashed and are stored as entered.  In a real application, hashing or a 3'rd part euthentication app would be used.
